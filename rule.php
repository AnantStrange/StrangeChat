Absolutely No CP will be tolerated.

Want to ask a question?
Ask the Damm question straight up.

No Instagram/Facebook hacking requests.
Selling hacking services are absolutely prohibited(expecially telegram)
Discussing weakness and techniques about social media is fair game tho.

Discussing leaks,sharing links is mildly tolerated at best but no begging for Leaks.

Do NOT clutter the chat with !commands, send them to @void.

Got scammed?
Well sorry to hear that, but suck it up. Learn the lesson, and NO! no one can
get your money back. Its not possible and if someone offers to help you in exchange of money is most definately a scam!
